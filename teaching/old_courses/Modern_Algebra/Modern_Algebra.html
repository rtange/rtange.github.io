<li>I. <i>Basic definitions</i>: definition of a ring, commutative ring, unit, zero divisors, integral domain, field, field of fractions of an integral domain.<br>
Examples: $\mathbb Z, \mathbb Q, \mathbb R, \mathbb C$, matrices/linear transformations, polynomials, functions, $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$.<br>
Subring, ideal (generated by a set), homomorphism, kernel, image, first isomorphism theorem, prime ideal, maximal ideal.<br>
The characteristic of a ring, the $p$-th power map in characteristic $p$.
<li>II. <i>Principal ideal domains & unique factorisation</i>: irreducible and prime elements.<br>
Principal ideal domain, unique factorisation domain, Examples: $\mathbb{Z}$ and $F[X]$ (division with remainder and Euclid's gcd algorithm for polynomials).<br>

<div id="myContent3" style="display: none">
<ul>
<li> The lecture on Tuesday 19-2-2013.<br>
I wrote ${\rm End}_F(V)$ (<i>not ${\rm End}_F(N)$</i> as several people thought) for the ring of all linear maps $:V\to V$.
Here &#8220 End&#8221 stands for &#8220 endomorphism&#8221 which is a morphism (= map which preserves structure) from a mathematical object
to itself. Next lecture I hope to write more clearly with a better marker.<br>
In the definition of zero divisor you should assume the ring to be commutative.<br>
You should be able to do some of the exercises on Sheet 1 <i>after the next lecture</i>.
<li> The lecture on Thursday 21-2-2013.<br>
As one of the students pointed out, in the line &#8220 $p|p!=\binom{p}{i}i!$&#8221 , $p!$ should be replaced by $p(p-1)\cdots(p-i+1)$.
So it should be &#8220$p|p(p-1)\cdots(p-i+1)=\binom{p}{i}i!$&#8221.<br>
I forgot to say what an isomorphism is. For rings, as for all algebraic stuctures, it is a bijective (= 1-1 and onto) homomorphism.
<li> The lecture on Monday 25-2-2013.<br>
Maybe I should have reminded you of cosets: $x+I$ means $\{x+y\,|\,y\in I\}$ which is an additive version of $xN=\{xy\,|\,y\in N\}$, $N$ a (normal) subgroup of a group $G$.<br>
So our cosets are just a special case of those in the first part of the course: we form quotients by additive subroups
(recall that in an abelian group every subgroup is normal).<br> The difference is that we give the set of all cosets (the quotient $R/I$ of a ring $R$ by an ideal
$I$) more structure: the multiplication.<br>
This lecture was somewhat dogmatic, but quotients will be important later on in the course where we consider quotients of the polynomial ring
$F[X]$ as extensions of $F$.
<li> The lecture on Tuesday 26-2-2013.<br>
In my remarks about sheet 2 I wrote twice $I/R$. That should have been $R/I$.<br>
The next two sections will be more explicit.
We will mainly be dealing with $\mathbb Z$, $\mathbb Q[X]$, $\mathbb Z[X]$ and
subfields of $\mathbb C$ that are finite dimensional as vector spaces over $\mathbb Q$.
<li> The lecture on Monday 4-3-2013.<br>
In the description of the Euclidean algorithm for the computation of the gcd I said &#8220$R=\mathbb Z$ or $F[X]$&#8221, but then I wrote $\deg(r_k)$
which doesn't make sense for integers. However, the algorithm and Thm 4 work for any Euclidean domain. I won't say what that is exactly,
you can find a precise definition in the literature, but in vague terms it is an integral domain which has a degree function and a division 
with remainder &#8220algorithm&#8221 (actually quotient and remainder are not required to be unique). The integers form a Euclidean domain with the
absolute value as degree function. So what I wrote makes sense for the integers if you repace $\deg$ by the absolute value. I think, however, that it
would be more natural in the case $R=\mathbb Z$ to just omit $\deg$ and take all $r_k\ge0$: $r_{-1}=|a|$, $r_0=|b|$ and $r_{k+1}$ is the remainder under
division of $r_{k-1}$ by $r_k$, so $0\le r_{k+1}< r_k$.
<li> The lecture on Tuesday 5-3-2013.<br>
For those of you who still struggle with calculating modulo ideals:
For a subgroup $H$ of of a group $G$ be have $xH=yH$ iff $y^{-1}x\in H$.
So for an ideal $I$ of a ring $R$ we have $x+I=y+I$ iff $x-y\in I$: we apply the results from the first part of the course with additive notation.
Note also that the zero element of $R/I$ is $I$ and the unit element is $1+I$.<br>
For the exercises on sheet 2 you may use that in every PID we have unique factorisation into irreducibles. We will see next lecture that the minimal polynomial
over $\mathbb Q$ of a complex number $\alpha$ which is algebraic over $\mathbb Q$ is characterised by the properties that it is monic, irreducible and zero at
$\alpha$ (It should now already be clear that these conditions are sufficient). This should be enough to do all the exercises on sheet 2.<br>
A hint for question 1(ii):
First show that for a maximal ideal $I$ of $R$ and $a\in R\setminus I$ we have $I+Ra=R$. Extra hints for question 4: First note that $X^4+64$ is either irreducible over
$\mathbb Q$ or the product of two irreducible polynomials of degree two in $\mathbb Q[X]$. In the latter case each of these must be a product of two linear
(= of degree 1) factors over $\mathbb C$. To factor $X^4+64$ into irreducibles over $\mathbb C$ you could begin by observing that over $\mathbb C$ it is the difference of two squares ($a^2+b^2=a^2-(ib)^2$).
<li> The lecture on Thursday 7-3-2013.<br>
So the two main applications of the fact that $F[X]$ is a PID are
<ul>
<li>The definition of the gcd (and lcm) in $F[X]$. This leads via Prop 5(1) to the proof that $F[X]$ is a UFD (Thm 7).
<li>The definition of the minimal polynomial for an element $a$ in an extension ring $R$ of $F$ ($R$ commutative, or, more generally, $F\subseteq Z(R)$).
</ul>
I give an alternative (but equivalent) definition of a UFD. Recall that $a\sim b$ means that $a$ is a unit times $b$.<br>
<b>Def</b>. Let $R$ be an integral domain and let $P$ be a set of $\sim$-representatives for the irreducible elements (if $R=F[X]$, then we can take $P$ the set of monic irreducible polynomials). Then $R$ is called a <i>unique factorisation domain</i> (UFD) if for every $a\in R$ there exist unique integers $k_p\ge0$, $p\in P$, finitely many nonzero, such that $a\sim\prod_{p\in P}p^{k_p}$.
<li> The lecture on Thursday 14-3-2013.<br>
When I say &#8220....an extension $F\subseteq K$....&#8221 the word extension refers to the whole expression $F\subseteq K$, <b>not</b> just $F$. So I say: $K$ is an extension of $F$ or $F\subseteq K$ is an extension, where, in the latter case, I refer to the whole expression $F\subseteq K$.<br>
If you find it awkward to work with the ring $F[X]/(f_\alpha)$, then you can identify it with the space of polynomials of degree $<\deg(f_\alpha)$ with obvious addition and with multiplication: $f\cdot g\stackrel{\rm def}{=}$ the remainder of $fg$ under division by $f_\alpha$. Indeed each class modulo $(f_\alpha)$ has a unique representant (element) of degree $<\deg(f_\alpha)$. Note that the underlying vector space only depends on $\deg(f_\alpha)$, but the multiplication depends on $f_\alpha$ itself.
<li> The lecture on Monday 18-3-2013.<br>
Please look again at the definition of &#8220 subring generated by&#8221 and at Prop II.6 and its corollary. In fact Prop II.6 is one of the most fundamental results of the course.
<li> The lecture on Thurday 21-3-2013.<br>
I was hesitating a bit when I wanted to show that $X^4+1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb Q$. I had in mind to show that it is irreducible modulo $3$ and then apply Cor. 3 to Prop. 8 (Gauss' lemma). Indeed $X^4+1$ has no roots in $\mathbb F_3$, but since it is of degree $4$ that  doesn't prove that it is irreducible over $\mathbb F_3$. In fact it factorises modulo $3$ as $X^4+1=(X^2+X-1)(X^2-X-1)$! Fortunately, the implication in the above corollary is only in one direction. It still follows by Eisenstein's criterion with $p=2$ that $(X+1)^4+1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb Q$. So $X^4+1$ is also irreducible over $\mathbb Q$.
<li> The lecture on Tuesday 26-3-2013.<br>
What the proof of Prop II.6 and even more the proof of Thm III.5 seem to be saying is that the roots of an irreducible polynomial are all &#8220 the same&#8221.<br>
&nbsp What I showed at the end of the lecture is that for a finite normal extension $F\subseteq K$ and for any finite ${\rm Gal}(K/F)$-stable subset $\mathcal O$ of $K$, the polynomial $\prod_{\alpha\in\mathcal O}(X-\alpha)$ is in $F[X]$.<br>
For example, we can take $K=\mathbb Q(\zeta)$, $\zeta$ a primitive $n$-th root of unity. Then the set $\mathcal O_n=\{\zeta^m\,|\,0\le m < n, {\rm gcd}(m,n)=1\}$ of primitive $n$-th roots of unity is a finite ${\rm Gal}(K/\mathbb Q)$-stable subset of $K$.
So $\Phi_n(X)=\prod_{\xi\ \text{of order}\ n}(X-\xi)$ is in $\mathbb Q[X]$. Since it is a monic divisor of $X^n-1$, it follows by Cor 2 to Prop II.8 that it is in $\mathbb Z[X]$. The polynomial $\Phi_n$ is called the <i>$n$-th cyclotomic polynomial</i>. One can show that it is irreducible over $\mathbb Q$ (we did this for $n$ a prime). So $\mathcal O_n$ is actually a single ${\rm Gal}(K/\mathbb Q)$-orbit.
<li> The lecture on Thursday 28-3-2013.<br>
For those interested in finite fields: The Galois groups of finite extensions of finite fields are always cyclic.
</ul>
</div>
Final remark about finding the Galois group of a finite normal extension $F\subseteq K$ in $\mathbb C$.<br>
If $K$ is given as $K=F(\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n)$, then any $F$-linear automorphism is determined
by what it does to the $\alpha_i$. Furthermore, an element of $K$ can only be moved to one
of its conjugates over $F$.
So if $\alpha_i$ has $m_i$ conjugates over $F$ (including itself), then that gives us $m_1\cdots m_n$
<i>possible</i> automorphisms. Just choose for each $\alpha_i$ a conjugate over $F$.
If you can somehow show that the order of the Galois group is also $m_1\cdots m_n$
(usually by showing that $[K:F]=m_1\cdots m_n$), then you know that all above possibilities
must occur and you have determined the Galois group as a set.
Then you can pick out suitable automorphisms that move one of the $\alpha_i$ and
fix all the others, and show that they generate the Galois group.
This gives the Galois group as a set and in small examples you can determine the  group structure
by determining a commutation rule for the generators.
The above cardinality argument avoids the application of the argument from the
proof of Thm III.5 that I used in the notes and the solutions to the exercises.
The latter is more insightful, but the former is shorter.
