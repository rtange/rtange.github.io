<h3><a id="myHeader2" href="javascript:toggle('myContent3','myHeader3');">Remarks about the lectures</a></h3>
<div id="myContent3" style="display: none">
<ul>
<li> For the basics about sets and functions, see the pdf documents on sets and functions in the section Further Resources on the ELE page for this course.
<li> The lecture on 30-9-2013.<br>
The <i>order of an element</i> $x\in G$ is defined as the smallest integer $r>0$ such that $x^r=e$ if such an $r$ exists and $\infty$ otherwise.<br>
The <i>order of a group</i> is the number of elements it contains.<br>
We have seen that that the order of $x\in G$ is equal to the order of the subgroup $\langle x\rangle$ it generates.<br>
So, by Lagrange's Theorem, the order of $x\in G$ divides the order of $G$.<br>
Recall that Lagrange's Theorem says that the order of a subgroup of a group $G$ always divides the order of $G$.
<li> The lecture on 7-10-2013.<br>
Another way to state the result that $\{{\rm Orb}(x)\,|\,x\in X\}$ is a partition of a set $X$ on which the group $G$ acts is to say that the relation<br>
$x\sim y\stackrel{\rm def}{\Longleftrightarrow} \exists_{g\in G}\,x=g\cdot y$<br>
is an equivalence relation on $X$.<br>
For the definitions of partition and equivalence relation see one of the pdf documents on sets and functions in the section Further Resources<br>
on the ELE page for this course.
<li> The lecture on 18-10-2013.<br>
Recall that when a group $G$ acts on a set $X$ I said that $x,y\in X$ are <i>conjugate</i> if $\exists_{g\in G}\,x=g\cdot y$.<br>
If I say that $x,y\in G$ are conjugate without specifying under which action of which group, then I always mean under the conjugation action of $G$ on itself.<br>
So $x,y\in G$ are conjugate if (and only if) $\exists_{g\in G}\,x=gyg^{-1}$.
<li> The lecture on 25-10-2013.<br>
The issue with the well-definedness of the multiplication on $G/H$ and the homomorphism $\overline{\varphi}$ of the First Isomorphism Theorem is that the elements<br>
on which these maps are defined are expressions involving a
&ldquo;parameter&rdquo;, and this parameter is used in the definition of the function.<br>
In the first case the expressions are $(g_1H,g_2H)$ involving the parameter $(g_1,g_2)$,
in the second case the expressions are $gK$ involving the parameter $g$.<br>
An example of totally different nature may make things more clear.
Let $Q=\{n^2\,|\,n\in\mathbb Z\}\subset\mathbb Z$ be the set of squares of integers.<br>
Then we could attempt to define a map $f:Q\mathbb\to\mathbb Z$ by
$f(n^2)=n+1$. Then $1^2=(-1)^2$, but $1+1\ne-1+1$. So $f$ is not well-defined.<br>
If we define $f:Q\mathbb\to\mathbb Z$ by $f(n^2)=|n|+1$, then $f$ is well-defined.
<li> The lecture on 4-11-2013.<br>
When I defined the product of two polynomials I wrote $f(X)g(X)=\sum_{i=0}^{mn}c_iX^i$, where $c_i=\cdots$.<br>
This should have been $f(X)g(X)=\sum_{i=0}^{m+n}c_iX^i$, where $c_i=\cdots$.
<li> The lecture on 14-11-2013.<br>
Note that $R/\{0\}\cong R$ (in the case of groups we have $G/\{1\}\cong G$).
<li> The lecture on 22-11-2013.<br>
In the proof of the existence part of the theorem that every PID is a UFD I should probably have expressed the idea a bit more clear.<br>
The idea is that If $a\in R\setminus\{0\}$ is not irreducible, then you can write $a=bc$ where $b$ and $c$ are non-units.<br>
If $b$ is not irreducible then, you can write it as a product $b=b_1b_2$ where $b_1,b_2$ are non-units. So then $a=bc=b_1b_2c$.<br>
The same applies of course to $c$ and to $b_1$ and $b_2$. So we can continue replacing certain non-irreducible factors in a factorisation of $a$<br>
by a product of two non-units until all the factors are irreducible. Note, however, that it is not clear why this process should terminate.<br>
This is why I used the absolute value in the case of $\mathbb Z$ and the degree in the case of $F[X]$.
<li> The lecture on 29-11-2013.<br>
I was a  bit distracted when I gave the proof of Eisenstein's criterion.<br>
The argument was almost complete:
We have $f(X)=g(X)h(X)$ (*), where $g(X)$ has degree l and $h(X)$ has degree $m$. So $l+m=n$.<br>
Now we had  $a_nX^n=g(X)h(X)$ modulo $p$ (**). So $g(X)$ and $h(X)$ are modulo $p$ scalar multiples of powers of $X$.<br>
But $h(X)$ has a constant term which is nonzero mod $p$, so modulo $p$ it has to be a constant.<br>
Here I got a bit stuck. I wanted that $h(X)$ itself is a constant. A degree argument gives this:<br>
By (**) $g(X)$ has to be a multiple of $X^n$ modulo $p$, so its degree modulo $p$ is $n$, but then its (ordinary) degree $l$ is also $n$.<br>
So $m=0$, i.e. $h(X)$ is a constant.<br>
Another way to get there goes as follows. From (*) and the fact that $a_n$ is nonzero mod $p$ it follows that $b_lc_m=a_n\not\equiv0$ mod $p$, so $b_l,c_m\not\equiv0$ mod $p$.<br>
But we also know that $c_0\not\equiv0$ mod $p$ and that $h(X)$ is modulo $p$ a scalar multiple of a power of $X$. So we must have $m=0$, i.e. $h(X)$ is a constant.
<li> The lecture on 2-12-2013.<br>
Standard examples of complex numbers that are not algebraic numbers (such numbers are called transcendental (over $\mathbb Q$)) are $e$ and $\pi$.<br>
The proof that these are indeed not algebraic numbers is beyond the scope of this course. It is, however, not to hard to show that the set of algebraic<br>
numbers is countable. Since $\mathbb C$ is uncountable, this shows at least that there are transcendental numbers, uncountably many in fact.
<li> The lecture on 6-12-2013.<br>
The final remark that I made about finding all the roots of a polynomial $X^n-a$, $a\in\mathbb C\setminus\{0\}$ can be used to find factorisations over the real or rational<br>
numbers by first factorising over the complex numbers, i.e. finding all the roots. For example, you can find a factorisation of $X^4+4$ over $\mathbb R$ (or $\mathbb Q$) by first<br>
finding the root $\sqrt{2}\zeta_8$, where $\zeta_8=e^{2\pi i/8}$ and then finding the others using the remark from the lecture. Finally you can then find a real factorisation by<br>
taking factors corresponding to complex conjugate roots together.
